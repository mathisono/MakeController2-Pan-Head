 \page Tools Tools
  The Make Controller is supported by great open source tools.

  The easiest way to get started programming the Make Controller is with \b mcbuilder, a program that provides 
  a simple development environment, compiler and uploader in a single download.  Check the 
  <a href="http://www.makingthings.com/resources/downloads">MakingThings download page</a> for details.
  
  Otherwise, programs for the Make Controller Kit can be built using the freely available ARM-flavored 
  version of the GCC compiler, \b arm-elf-gcc.  Many toolchains are available - OS X and Windows versions can 
  be found on the <a href="http://www.makingthings.com/resources/downloads">MakingThings download page</a>.
	Other good options include:
	- GNU-ARM: http://www.gnuarm.com
	- WinARM (Windows-only): http://www.siwawi.arubi.uni-kl.de/avr_projects/arm_projects/#winarm
	- YAGARTO (Windows-only): http://www.yagarto.de

	To upload new firmware to your Make Controller, you have a few options:
	- Use \b mcbuilder (Make Controller Builder) or \b mchelper (Make Controller Helper), from <a href="http://www.makingthings.com/resources/downloads">MakingThings</a>.
	- Use \b sam7utils, a command line app: http://oss.tekno.us/sam7utils
	- Use a JTAG device.

	Rowley also provides a very good IDE for ARM7 projects called \b CrossWorks, which supports in-circuit debugging.  There are single user
	licenses available.  Check http://www.rowley.co.uk/arm/index.htm
